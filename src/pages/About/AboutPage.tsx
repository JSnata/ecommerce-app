                  The team was assembled from participants whom the mentor chose as his wards. Since February, we began
                  to communicate a lot and help each other with individual tasks. When it came time to assemble teams
                  for a group project, we did not hesitate to form a team. Our communication is set up well, Discord has
                  sections for specific occasions, and Trello helps us manage tasks.
